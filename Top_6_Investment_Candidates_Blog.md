Top 6 Investment Candidates - Radar Analysis Beyond Numbers
By Emine Ceran - Financial Data Analyst in Training

Introduction

In today's data-driven financial world, we often find ourselves obsessed with numbers: revenue, net margins, PE ratios, debt levels.
But the more I study investment analysis, the more I realize:

> Numbers are necessary, but not enough.

Behind every metric is a product, a consumer, a habit.
And sometimes, real investment insight comes from asking simple, human questions like:

- "How often does this product enter my home?"
- "Is this brand accessible to both the wealthiest and the poorest?"
- "Is this company truly sustainable, or just profitable?"

This blog is my journey through both data and intuition â€” and how I chose 6 global companies to analyze based on both.

The Process: Filtering & Scoring

From a list of 20+ companies, I applied strict financial filters:
- Revenue Growth > 15%
- Net Profit Margin > 10%
- Debt to Equity < 2
- PE Ratio < 40
- Dividend Yield > 1%

Then I normalized the data (0-1 scale) to allow fair visual comparison.
Each metric was converted to a "score" â€” so even if revenue is in Â£millions and dividends in %, we could still see relative strength.

ðŸ•¸ # The Result: Radar Chart

Using Excel and Python, I created a radar chart comparing 6 selected companies:

- Unilever - Profitability king, strong dividend
- HSBC - Safe, consistent, and low debt
- Toyota - Reliable long-term performer
- Nvidia - Explosive growth and AI power
- Meta - Undervalued with strong potential
- Samsung - Balance between tech innovation and stability

Each spoke of the chart represented a key metric.
The area covered = total strength profile.
No one company is perfect. But together, these six represent a diversified basket of strategic investments.

# What I Learned

This wasn't just about finding "the best stocks."
It was about learning how to think like an investor â€” one who balances:

- Hard data with
- Soft observation
- Quantitative models with
- Emotional intelligence

And most importantly:

> "A good investment isn't just profitable â€” it's relatable, sustainable, and human-centered."

#  Conclusion: My Investment Philosophy

I now understand why financial analysis is not just about spreadsheets.
It's about trust, trends, timing â€” and yes, a little bit of gut feeling.

So this is my first step.
And I dedicate it to anyone who ever felt like they weren't "data smart" enough.

Because if I can go from confusion to radar analysis â€” you can too.
